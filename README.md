# Gym-workouts-intensive
When I first began to workout at the gym, I'd be there for about 30 minutes and then I'd leave because I felt I didn't belong there.
At first, I didn't really know what I was doing and when I tried to figure it out by trial and error, I would just feel nervous the whole way and not like I really made a difference in my health by attempting to work out. I later found out that I was not alone. Others get intimidated to workout at a gym even with all the equipment provided just becuase they don't really know how to use it. 

I've created this website so you can "Click to workout". By this I mean you can just click on the body part that you would like to work on and then get
exercises specifically for that body part. This includes an image of the workout, as well as the steps and a video showing you how to do it.
This way you don't have to be switching through tabs searching up a workout and then looking for a video on how to complete it.

Give us a try and just click on a body part/muscle and enjoy your workout!
